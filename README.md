## This is a simple C# Windows Forms application that simulates a seven-segment display.
Each digit from 0 to 9 can be displayed by clicking its corresponding button, which lights up specific segments (represented by buttons) in red to form the number, while a reset button turns off all segments. The project demonstrates basic GUI handling, event-driven programming, and simple visual logic using the Windows Forms library.
